      <p>
        The game that most people call 'tennis' is the direct descendant of what
        is now known as real tennis or royal tennis (which continues to be
        played today as a separate sport with more complex rules). Most rules of
        the game commonly known as tennis derive from it. It is reasonable to
        see both sports as variations of the same game. The idea
        that tennis originated in the monastic cloisters in northern France in
        the 12th century has been largely discredited, but it is correct that in
        the first few centuries in which it was played, the ball was then struck
        with the palm of the hand; hence, the name jeu du peume ("game of the
        palm"). It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use,
        and the game began to be called "tennis." It was popular in England and
        France, and Henry VIII of England was a big fan of the game, now
        referred to as real tennis.
