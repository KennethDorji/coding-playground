        Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to
        ancient China. Greece, Rome, and parts of Central America also claim to
        have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer, or
        what the British and many other people around the world call “football,”
        into the game we know today. The English are credited with recording the
        first uniform rules for the sport, including forbidding tripping
        opponents and touching the ball with hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sport developed, more rules were implemented and more historical
        landmarks were set. For example, the penalty kick was introduced in
        1891. FIFA became a member of the International Football Association
        Board of Great Britain in 1913. Red and yellow cards were introduced
        during the 1970 World Cup finals. More recent major changes include
        goalkeepers being banned from handling deliberate back passes in 1992
        and tackles from behind becoming red-card penalties in 1998.
