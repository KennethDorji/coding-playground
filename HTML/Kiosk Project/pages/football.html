        The evolution of American football has been varied. Key influences were
        likely Greco-Roman games that left their mark in Europe. With the
        Medieval Period, those games emerged to form the beginnings of what
        would become rugby and soccer (or football). However, within that were
        the origins of American football. In the United States, it was concern
        over safety that led to rules that shaped what became American football
        and how it differed from its European counterparts (i.e., rugby and
        soccer). The formalization of rules and social events such as war (e.g.,
        World War I) further shaped the sport. The rapid expansion of popularity
        in the early 20th century eventually led to professional teams, which
        served as the foundation of the modern NFL. Along the way after the
        founding of the NFL, rules were refined, often influenced by the medium
        of television.
