        Major League Soccer (MLS) is a men's professional soccer league
        sanctioned by U.S. Soccer that represents the sport's highest level in
        both the United States and Canada, and constitutes one of the major
        professional sports leagues in both countries. The league comprises 24
        teams—21 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada.

        Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 as part of the United States'
        successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The first season took
        place in 1996 with ten teams. MLS experienced financial and operational
        struggles in its first few years: the league lost millions of dollars,
        teams played in mostly empty American football stadiums, and two teams
        folded in 2002. Since then, MLS has expanded to 24 teams,
        soccer-specific stadiums have proliferated around the league, average
        attendance exceeds that of the National Hockey League (NHL) and National
        Basketball Association (NBA), the Designated Player Rule allows teams to
        sign star players such as David Beckham, MLS secured national T’V
        contracts, and the league is now profitable.
