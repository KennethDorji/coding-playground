# Razatastic's Coding Playground 🎪

##### Note - It exists solely as a "playground" for me to experiment in. 👨🏽‍🔬

Normally, I wouldn't commit something like this. However, I tend to hop around from one computer to another and version control seems to be the best way to deal with this. Not only that, but I can keep track of my progress and see how far I've come when reflecting on my work! 😄
