# Coding Playground
### This repository is my collection of things I've worked on while hopping from one language to another. It exists solely as a "playground" for me to experiment in. Normallly, I wouldn't commit something like this. However, I tend to hop around from one computer to another and version control seems to be the best way to deal with this. Not only that, but I can keep track of my progress and see what I've done when reflecting on my work! :)
