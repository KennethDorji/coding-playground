# Tic-Tac-Toe
### How to play?
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

2. Player one is X, and player two is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty grid spaces.

3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in draw.

After both players enter their names, player one picks a number on the board to fill with his/her symbol. Players alternate turns until the board is either filled or a win condition is met.
