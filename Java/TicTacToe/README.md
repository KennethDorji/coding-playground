# Tic-Tac-Toe

### How to play?

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

- Player one is X, and player two is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty grid spaces.

- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in draw.
